# frontend_app

# BEFORE USING APP

1. first npm install then npm start
2. make sure backend_app is running

Network Errors may appear if using default localhost:3000 as URL.

IF SO DO THIS INSTEAD:

Under TaskList.ts and TaskForm.ts make sure to replace `API_BASE_URL` with your own IPv4 address to ensure best results with a spereate device on the same network,
use `ipconfig` in terminal to find your address.
